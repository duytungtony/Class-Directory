5. My wallet has 0.0665 SepoliaETH and using the formula 1 ETH=1018 Wei1 ETH=1018 Wei, the conversion for 0.0665 ETH should be 0.0665×1018=66500000000000000 Wei.
   With 'Check MetaMask Balance' it says 66503169086671390 Wei. The displayed balance might include very small fractions of ETH (dust amounts) that aren't typically visible in the MetaMask but are accounted for in the exact Wei balance.
   
Part B
The SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) is an initiative maintained by the Linux Foundation that provides a standardized format for documenting, communicating, and tracking software licenses in open-source projects. The goal of SPDX is to simplify license compliance and reduce legal uncertainty by ensuring that software projects clearly define their licensing terms. SPDX maintains a well-structured list of open-source licenses, enabling developers, organizations, and legal teams to easily understand the legal implications of using, modifying, and distributing software.

Scenario 1: License: Apache 2.0
•	Apache 2.0 is a permissive license, meaning it allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software without the obligation to open-source derivative works
•	It includes a patent grant, which protects contributors and users from patent-related legal issues.

Scenario 2: License: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)
•	MPL-2.0 is a weak copyleft license, which means modifications to open-source files must remain open-source, but proprietary code can coexist in the same project.
•	MPL-2.0 is commonly used when companies want to strike a balance between openness and retaining control over key intellectual property.

Part C 
1. Explanation of a Virtual Machine (VM) 
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine. VMs allow multiple operating systems to coexist on a single hardware platform, providing isolation, flexibility, and efficient resource utilization. In the context of blockchain, VMs execute smart contracts in a secure and deterministic environment, ensuring consistent outcomes across all nodes in the network.

2. Comparison of Developer Communities: EVM vs. SVM
EVM Community:
•	Maturity and Size: The EVM has been operational since Ethereum's launch in 2015, cultivating a large and mature developer community. This longevity has resulted in extensive documentation, numerous development tools, and a wealth of shared knowledge.
•	Ecosystem and Adoption: Due to its early entry, the EVM has achieved widespread adoption, with numerous decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols built upon it. This extensive ecosystem attracts developers seeking a well-established platform with a broad user base.
•	Resources and Support: The expansive community offers abundant resources, including tutorials, forums, and libraries, facilitating onboarding and development for newcomers and experienced developers alike.
SVM Community:
•	Performance and Scalability Focus: The SVM is designed to leverage Solana's high-throughput capabilities, supporting parallel transaction processing. This design appeals to developers prioritizing performance and scalability in their applications.
•	Emerging Ecosystem: While newer than the EVM, the SVM community is rapidly growing, driven by interest in Solana's technological advancements and its ability to handle a high volume of transactions with low latency.
•	Community Dynamics: The SVM community is characterized by innovation, with developers exploring novel use cases that leverage Solana's unique capabilities. However, being newer, it may have comparatively fewer resources and tools than the EVM ecosystem.
